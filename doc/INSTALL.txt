Installation / Deployment
----------------
Create config files
- settings.yml
- ldap.yml
- sunspot.yml
- database.yml

----------------
Full Text Searching
----------------
Apache Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ is the backend for text searching in the application. It is a Java application that must be running separately on the server.

This application was developed using Solr 3.6.2 and Solr 3.2 or greater is required for all functionality to work.

Text search is performed with the dismax parser. Solr configuration is present in:
/solr/conf/schema.xml(l. 65-75)
-Case insensitive indexing
-Synonyms are stored in synonyms.txt
-Tokens are min 1 max 15, from the front

solrconfig.xml (l. 485)
-100% of search terms must match

It is important to secure the solr index server from outside users. Block access to the solr port (default 8982, see solrconfig.xml) 
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity

Start the index with: 
>rake sunspot:solr:start

Build the index (one time) with:
>rake sunspot:reindex

----------------
Background Jobs
----------------
Some of the long running tasks are sent to Delayed Job: https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job for background processing (smoothing, conversion, etc..)

At least one background worker must be running on the server. To start delayed job:
>RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start

For multiple workers:
>RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start -n 3

----------------
Remote Auth
----------------
If connecting to an ldap database you need to setup config/ldap.yml: https://github.com/clyfe/devise_ldap_authenticatable
See config/ldap.yml.sample for example configuration.

----------------
NCBI-Blast
----------------
When Sequence is loaded a corresponding Blast database can be generated. This database will then be available through the tools->blast interface for custom blast searches. To enable this feature, :blast_path must be set in config/settings.yml.

in the blast_path/ directory the following executables must be present:
-formatdb
-blastall

See BLAST help from NCBI for more information: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download

----------------
Bedtools
----------------
The bedtools utilities will be used to convert Bam datafiles to Bedgraph format if present
To enable this feature the bedtools_path must be set in config/settings.yml

in the bedtools_path/ directory the following executable must be present:
-genomeCoverageBed

For more information about installing and using bedtools see:
http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

----------------
Bio-SQL
----------------
This application maintains a Bio-SQL schema to support community interaction. There are several extensions that increase functionality but the core Bio-SQL tables remain. Triggers/Procedures and most constraints are NOT present. This allows for a simpler database agnostic design.

When using ORACLE the oracle schema provided by bio-SQL is NOT used. The standard mySql / Postgresql schema is used throughout.
However, Oracle reserves the use of the word 'comment'; therefore the 'comment' table is converted to the plural form 'comments' when working with an oracle adapter.

The seqfeature -> display_name is used for Rails Single Table Inheritance. This is setup when loading features into the database.
seqfeature_qualifier_value -> value is a string field with a maximum of 4000 characters.

Left and Right nested set values for Taxon are NOT maintained during sequence load or default taxonomy load. Use taxonomy:load --nested_set if they are required.

Taxon has an extra 'non_ncbi' column. When custom taxon names are inserted during sequence load, this column is set to 1. These taxon items are ignored during subsequent taxonomy:load runs and will not be deleted/updated.
