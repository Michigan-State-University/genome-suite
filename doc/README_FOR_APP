Full Text Searching
----------------
Apache Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ is the backend for text searching in the application. It is a Java application that must be running separately on the server.

This application was developed using Solr 3.6.2 and Solr 3.2 or greater is required for all functionality to work. The sunspot_solr gem is installed for simple solr deployment. If you are going to use this Solr instance, it must be upgraded or, the search functions will fail. https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/wiki/Upgrading-sunspot_solr-Solr-Instance

Build the index (one time) with:
>rake sunspot:reindex

and start it with: 
>rake sunspot:solr:start

Solr configuration is present in /solr/conf/

It is important to secure the solr index server from outside users. Block access to the solr port (default 8983) 
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrSecurity

----------------
Background Jobs
----------------
Some of the long running tasks are sent to Delayed Job: https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job for background processing (smoothing, conversion, etc..)

At least one background worker must be running on the server. To start delayed job:
>script/delayed_job start

For multiple workers:
>script/delayed_job start -n 3

----------------
Remote Auth
----------------
If connecting to an ldap database you need to setup config/ldap.yml: https://github.com/clyfe/devise_ldap_authenticatable
See config/ldap.yml.sample for example configuration.

----------------
NCBI-Blast
----------------
When Sequence is loaded a corresponding Blast database can be generated. This database will then be available through the tools->blast interface for custom blast searches. To enable this feature, :blast_bin_path must be set in config/settings.yml.

in the blast_bin_path/ directory the following executables must be present:
-formatdb
-blastall

See BLAST help from NCBI for more information: http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download

----------------
Bio-SQL
----------------
This application maintains a Bio-SQL schema to support community interaction. There are several extensions that increase functionality but the core Bio-SQL tables remain. Triggers/Procedures and most constraints are NOT present. This allows for a simpler database agnostic design.

When using ORACLE the oracle schema provided by bio-SQL is NOT used. The standard mySql / Postgresql schema is used throughout.
However, Oracle reserves the use of the word 'comment'; therefore the 'comment' table is converted to the plural form 'comments' when working with an oracle adapter.

The seqfeature -> display_name is used for Rails Single Table Inheritance. This is setup when loading features into the database.
seqfeature_qualifier_value -> value is a varchar field with a maximum of 4000 characters.

Left and Right nested set values for Taxon are NOT maintained during sequence load or default taxonomy load. Use taxonomy:load --nested_set if they are required.

Taxon has an extra 'non_ncbi' column. When custom taxon names are inserted during sequence load, this column is set to 1. These taxon items are ignored during subsequent taxonomy:load runs and will not be deleted/updated.
